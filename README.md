# A Next.js starter for the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org)

> ⚠️ **Deprecation Notice** 🏳

> We are focusing our resources on building new templates that help you build a better web, because of that we're deprecating this template. We care about the community so we propose if anyone wants to maintain or take stewardship over the project please contact us at [devexperience@netlify.com](mailto:devexperience@netlify.com). If you want to share anything with the team about this template, you can also fill out [this form](https://template-feedback.netlify.app/).

This is a boilerplate for using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as a static site generator.

## Usage

### Getting started

To start your project, either:

1. Deploy to Netlify using the button above, or
2. Clone this repository and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will take some time and will install all packages necessary to run the starter.

### Development

While developing your website, use:

```bash
npm start
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000/ to preview your new website. The Next.js development server will automatically reload the CSS or refresh the whole page, when stylesheets or content changes.

### Static build

To build a static version of the website inside the `/dist` folder, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

See [package.json](package.json) for all tasks.

## Basic Concepts

You can read more about building sites and apps with Next.js in their documentation here:

https://nextjs.org/docs

## Doing dynamic things

A few resources for doing anything you can imagine with a 100% static site/app on the Jamstack
using Next.js. If you would like to add more resources please open a pull request!

## Deploying to Netlify

The deploy to Netlify button above will create a new site and repo in one click. If you've created your repo manually, you can deploy to Netlify as follows:

- Push your clone to your own GitHub repository.
- [Create a new site on Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/start) and link the repository.

Now Netlify will build and deploy your site whenever you push to git.
